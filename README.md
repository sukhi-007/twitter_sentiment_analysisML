Sentiment Analysis on Tweets Dataset
Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets obtained from Kaggle. The objective is to classify tweets as having positive or negative sentiment using machine learning techniques. Logistic regression was employed as the classification model, with appropriate preprocessing and evaluation steps.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing tweet text for analysis.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text into numerical form suitable for machine learning.

Model Training: Using logistic regression to classify tweets.

Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy on a test dataset.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle.

Description: Tweets labeled with sentiment:

1: Positive sentiment.

0: Negative sentiment.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation.

numpy: For numerical computations.

scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

nltk: For natural language processing (e.g., stopword removal, tokenization).

matplotlib/seaborn: For optional data visualization.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting tweets into words.

Stop Words Removal: Eliminating common words with little meaning.

Lemmatization/Stemming: Converting words to their base forms.

Removing special characters and punctuation.

TF-IDF vectorization for numerical representation of text.

2. Data Splitting
The dataset is split into:

Training Set: 80% for training the model.

Test Set: 20% for evaluating the model.

3. Model Training
Logistic regression is trained using the vectorized training data to learn sentiment patterns.

4. Evaluation
The modelâ€™s accuracy is tested on the unseen test dataset.

Results
Achieved reasonable accuracy in classifying tweets as positive or negative.

Demonstrated the effectiveness of logistic regression for sentiment analysis tasks.

Usage
Preprocess the dataset by running the preprocessing script.

Train the model using the training script.

Test the model on the test dataset to evaluate accuracy.

(Optional) Visualize the results using the provided plotting scripts.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate advanced text representation techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT.

Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Address class imbalance using oversampling or weighted loss functions.

Use external sentiment lexicons to enhance classification.
